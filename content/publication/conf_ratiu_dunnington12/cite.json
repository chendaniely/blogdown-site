Traditional in-situ remediation techniques have used natural precipitation and leachate recovery with some success, however sporadic quality assessment of recovered fluids yields limited control over leachate disposal methods and real-time assessment of remediation programs.  Evaluation of existing systems suggested that continuous monitoring of leachate quality, automated control and routing of the recovered fluids would further increase the efficiency of remediation process.  \n\nThe remediation technique implemented at the site includes installation of a flow-computer monitored and controlled leachate collection and recovery system enhanced by surface irrigation and subsurface injection.  Installation of continuous monitoring and automated control within the leachate recovery portion of the in-situ remediation system provides data recording, communications support, electrical conductivity (EC) monitoring, and valve control.  A flow-computer directs recovered fluid with low EC values toward a series of surface irrigation and subsurface injection systems, or concentrated brine with high EC values toward a series of storage tanks for subsequent deep-well injection.  Additional wells and routing options provide further controls on the remediation program.  The program demonstrates how modern technologies can be used to fuel developments in alternative in-situ remediation for salt-impacted soils, providing further opportunities for cost-effective, successful remediation."],"URL":["https://www.esaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/12-Ratiu.pdf"],"author":[{"family":["Ratiu"],"given":["Ion"]},{"family":["Dunnington"],"given":["Dewey W."]}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,10]]},"publisher-place":["Banff, Alberta"]}
