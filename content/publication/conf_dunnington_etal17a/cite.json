Stable Pb is present in measurable concentrations in many lake sediments, is easily and cost-effectively measured, and often follows a regional pattern of increase following aerial deposition of particulates from industrial development. We measured stable Pb concentrations in seven ^210^Pb-dated sediment cores near Halifax, Nova Scotia using X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Pb concentrations ranged from non-detect (~2 ppm) to 155 ppm, with a substantial increase observed between 1900 and 1930. Peak lead concentration dates were variable, but generally ocurred between 1970 and 1990. The timing of the initial increase was within the range of ^210^Pb age-depth model error for all lakes, suggesting a common aerial source for lead in the Halifax region. Using stable Pb concentrations, ^210^Pb age-depth model error, and rescaling methods, a unified stable Pb sediment chronology was constructed for the Halifax region. This chronology could be applied to create age-depth models for lake sediment cores for which no ^210^Pb data are available."],"author":[{"family":["Dunnington"],"given":["D.W."]},{"family":["Spooner"],"given":["I.
