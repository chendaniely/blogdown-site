I'm happy to announce that after a week-long struggle with the intricacies of the Android AppWidget framework, I've just released a new version of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.fwe.caweather">Canada Weather</a>. Over the past year requests have piled up involving more flexibility for the widget, better use of space on the widget, antiquated user interface, no option for sound on warning notifications, and many more that I didn't get the chance to implement in this update. In particular, the app features a shiny new user interface powered by the <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index.html">AppCompat framework</a>, which provides an API to make apps look and feel like the stock Google apps. It's been far too long since the last update, but I hope this keeps Canada Weather on the top of the Canadian Weather game!
