Dewey Dunnington is an environmental researcher and programmer based in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Deweyâ€™s environmental research investigates the mechanisms that control toxic metals in lakes, while his programming has led him to develop mobile applications, web apps, and R packages, most recently as the ggplot2 summer intern with RStudio. He is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in the Centre for Water Resources Studies at Dalhousie University.
